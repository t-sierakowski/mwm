      <p>Natural looking makeup is our most popular choice from our local brides. The reasoning is simple;  they want to look like themselves! Our main concern is to perfect the skin to appear flawless in photos. We have taken the time to research the best primers and foundations to feel light on the skin but delivery results of perfection on camera! Its the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>Defining the brows and contouring your cheeks will be two of the most important, and often missed steps in natural makeup. Its all about beautiful lines around your features to make them pop without the added color you might be intimated by. This is so you do not look flat in your photos. Strategically placing contours and highlights creates a dynamic look and allows us to add soft color where necessary like keeping lips simple by wearing your favorite gloss or tinted chap stick.</p>

      <h1>#2- ROMANTIC CHARM</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="left-defining">Defining Details of Style :</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft Roses & Champagnes</li>
        <li>Defined Brow and Lash Line</li>
        <li>Lips In Shades of Pink</li>
        <li>Tinted Glossy Lip Color</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Our romantic bridal style is one of our top picked designs. I love the color range it allows us to play in, from eyes that are accented in soft rose undertones and seemingly natural with brightening, eye opening designs. To evening ready with smoky grays, charcoals that smoke our the lash line and contrast with warm cheek colors.</p>
      <p>The simple yet beautiful rose lip can be worn by everyone and can be tweaked to go more warm or cool with a sheer lip gloss. We can mix and match foundations and powders to create a soft satin flawless finish on the all skin types and use highlights to bring out the cheek bones. I love the brow definition with this style, keeping the lash line simple over going bold with thick lashes allows the entire application to contain a complete look over one defining accent.</p>
