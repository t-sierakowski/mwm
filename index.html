  <p>What I love about our state of Maryland is that we are so diverse. The unique and beautiful sums up our local brides. We rarely see the same type of wedding even with everyone designing from similar Pinterest boards and using the same wedding professionals. That was my inspiration for creating my Seven Local Bridal Styles. It stemmed from this idea that our brides should think about what kind of style of makeup they fall into without feeling overwhelmed. Its ok to be a little selfish and make sure you are the shining star. Hair, makeup, accessories and of course the dress should all work together to represent you completely!  What is your personality? Favorite color or season? Letâ€™s narrow down your thoughts and figure out how to enhance your unique style. I hope these bring you inspiration for your wedding!</p>
