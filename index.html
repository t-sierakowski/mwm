    <p>Natural looking makeup is our most popular choice from our local brides. The reasoning is simple;  they want to look like themselves! Our main concern is to perfect the skin to appear flawless in photos. We have taken the time to research the best primers and foundations to feel light on the skin but delivery results of perfection on camera! Its the best of both worlds.</p>
    <p>Defining the brows and contouring your cheeks will be two of the most important, and often missed steps in natural makeup. Its all about beautiful lines around your features to make them pop without the added color you might be intimated by. This is so you do not look flat in your photos. Strategically placing contours and highlights creates a dynamic look and allows us to add soft color where necessary like keeping lips simple by wearing your favorite gloss or tinted chap stick.</p>
