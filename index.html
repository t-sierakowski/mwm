    <ul>
      <li>Flawless Highlighted Skin</li>

    <p>Natural looking makeup is our most popular choice for our local brides. The reasoning is simple;  they want to look like themselves! Our primary concern is to perfect the skin to appear flawless in photos. We have taken the time to research the best primers and foundations to feel light on the skin but delivery results of perfection on camera! It's the best of both worlds.</p>
    <p>Defining the brows and contouring your cheeks will be two of the most important, and often missed steps in natural makeup. Its all about beautiful lines around your features to make them pop without the added color you might be intimated by. This is so you do not look flat in your photos. Strategically placing contours and highlights creates a dynamic look and allows us to add soft color where necessary like keeping lips simple by wearing your favorite gloss or tinted chap stick.</p>

      <h1>#2- ROMANTIC CHARM</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="left-defining">Defining Details of Style :</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Soft Roses & Champagnes</li>
        <li>Defined Brow and Lash Line</li>
        <li>Lips In Shades of Pink</li>
        <li>Tinted Glossy Lip Color</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Our romantic bridal style is one of our top picked designs. I love the color range it allows us to play in, from eyes that are accented in soft rose undertones and seemingly natural with brightening, eye-opening designs. To evening ready with smoky grays, charcoals that smoke our the lash line and contrast with warm cheek colors.</p>
      <p>The simple yet beautiful rose lip can be worn by everyone and can be tweaked to go more warm or cool with a sheer lip gloss. We can mix and match foundations and powders to create a soft satin flawless finish on all skin types and use highlights to bring out the cheek bones. I love the brow definition with this style, keeping the lash line simple over going bold with thick lashes allows the entire application to contain a complete look over one defining accent.</p>

      <h1>#3- DAZZLING GOLDS</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="right-defining">Defining Details of Style :</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Various Coral Toned Lips</li>
        <li>Golden Undertone Pallets</li>
        <li>Shimmer on Cheeks & Eyes</li>
        <li>Bronzers & Color Opposite Accents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dazzling Gold’s is a favorite makeup combination for our summer to fall brides. Bronzer is pretty much a must and we add fun gold shimmers to highlight on the cheeks to give off a natural glow. I am in love with adding greens and pops of an opposite color to the eye makeup. Sweeping a kiss of purple into a coral shimmer creates added dynamic that translates on camera but isn’t necessarily seen face to face.</p>
      <p>Just because it’s not summer doesn’t mean this isn’t for you. Gold’s, browns, and corals can be tweaked to flow with most wedding colors and seasons. The skin is kept semi-matte to fight the heat and I am a huge fan of a simple peachy lip gloss for the finishing touch. This look is easy to wear and best worn for brides who want to embrace a warm color palette or for those who find shimmery makeup a must have!</p>

      <h1>#4- CLASSIC ROUGE</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class="left-defining">Defining Details of Style :</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong, Sweeping Eyeliner</li>
        <li>Natural Bright Eyes to Gray Smokey</li>
        <li>Red Undertone Lip from Bold to Soft</li>
        <li>Perfected Satin Skin</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our Classic Rouge design came from our clients looking to rock out that red lip but was stumped on what to do with their eye design. The fun part about this look is that you can go a couple of different ways with the eyes ranging from the thickness of liner, smokiness of shadows, and even keeping the eye natural.</p>
      <p>We highly suggest using a couple of layers of stain and lipstick to keep your lip in place most of the night. Brides getting married in the summer and fall tend to wear this look the most. However, the defining eye liner, thick lashes, and a nude lip can be a “classic” look as well. This style works year round without the ‘fear’ of wearing a bright lip design!</p>
