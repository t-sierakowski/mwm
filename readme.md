<h1>Company Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>3/5 Wanted to attempt to restyle one of my company pages using what I've learned so far in class. Not going to work on the header information yet. There are seven total styles. Going to work on the first one style wise first for a left column img and the right data, then switch it using a different class.</p>
